<p>I haven&rsquo;t used PostgreSQL in a while.  I had instances running on my home server and my development laptop, primarily for my <a href="https://github.com/sore0159/overpower">overpower</a> project.  Since then I&rsquo;ve been working on more single-user projects with smaller persistence requirements, and haven&rsquo;t felt the need to delve into setting up tables and program-db communications.</p>

<p>My latest project requires a db, so I have spent some time digging through my old config files, actual paper files, and documentation pages.  After a night of this I do have a new and functional setup for postgresql on both my laptop and server.</p>

<h3>Upgrading Postgres (9.4 -&gt; 9.6)</h3>

<p>On debian, apt-get managed the upgrade quite simply, but with all passwords, roles, and tables half-lost over the past year, I decided a full database clear was a good idea.  Rather than manually purge files, the pg_dropcluster command followed by the pg_createcluster served this purpose.</p>

<p>On macOS, brew install postgresql seemed to work, but after some exploration I noticed the psql command would report a self-version of 9.6, but a <em>server</em> version of 9.4.  Investigation revealed that the previous install of Postgres had been done via the &lsquo;Enterprise Installer&rsquo;.  I had to completely uninstall postgresql 9.4 via the uninstall binary in the 9.4 directory, then reinstall 9.6 via homebrew.</p>

<h3>Role &amp; Authentication Configuration</h3>

<p>Initially Postgres is setup to authenticate based on the system-user name of the attempted login, rather than using passwords.  For this, using <code>sudo -u</code> to mock the Postgres system name is useful.  I discovered that homebrew&rsquo;s postgresql superuser was <em>not</em> postgres, but instead the username of the account that ran the install.</p>

<p>Using psql, I used the CREATE USER command to set up a non-superuser with role and db creation privileges, and with an encrypted password.  Then the task was to switch postgresql to password based authentication and never use the superuser account again.</p>

<p>For this, I had to find the pg_hba.conf file.  In debian it was in the expected /etc/postgres/9.6/ directory, but on macOS I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure where homebrew kept it&rsquo;s files.  Using the command <code>ps aux | grep postgres</code> I was able to investigate the -D flag the server was using, which gave the data directory ( /usr/local/var/postgres ).</p>

<p>Setting authentication to md5 and restarting the postgresql servers, I was then able to log via <code>psql -U</code>, and start setting up the actual roles and databases for my programs to use.</p>

<h3>Misc. Notes</h3>

<p>The psql tool was invaluable in investigating and testing the state of Postgres.  One thing I learned quickly was that when I wanted to log in to psql, I needed to specify a database.  During setup I hadn&rsquo;t even created a database, but &lsquo;template1&rsquo; served as a system-generated database that I could use.</p>

<p>The details of setting up roles and databases are not included here, as I found <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static">Postgres&rsquo;s Docs</a> to adequately cover the commands and options involved.</p>
